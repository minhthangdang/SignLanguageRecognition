# Sign Language Recognition
Deep learning for sign language recognition using MNIST image dataset

## Problem Statement

This is my own extended exercise of Coursera's Improving Deep Neural
Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization which I have
passed (https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/KDWADX7V43SS)

In the course, the programming assignment is to implement a deep neural network
model to recognize numbers from 0 to 5 in sign language. Whereas, in this
exercise I adapt the model to recognize 24 classes of letters (excluding J and Z)
in American Sign Language.
